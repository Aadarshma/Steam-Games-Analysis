# Steam-Games-Analysis
Analyzed Steam game data using Python (Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib) to explore trends in pricing, ownership, ratings, and genres. Visualized insights like price vs. rating correlation, popular genres, and release patterns. Focused on data cleaning, EDA, and effective storytelling through visualizations.
In this project, I performed a comprehensive data analysis on a large dataset of Steam video games to uncover meaningful insights into user preferences, pricing strategies, and genre trends. Using Python, I applied libraries like Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, and Seaborn to clean the data, explore key patterns, and visualize findings through clear and compelling charts.

🔍 Key Objectives and Questions Explored:

Most Popular Genres – Identified top-performing genres based on ownership and user engagement.

Price vs. Positive Rating Ratio – Analyzed whether cost influences user satisfaction using correlation analysis and scatter plots.

Free vs Paid Games – Quantified how many games are free and explored how this impacts user ratings and downloads.

Top Developers & Publishers – Ranked studios by the number of games released on Steam.

Release Trends Over Time – Visualized how game releases have increased or shifted across different years.

Top 10 Highest-Rated Games – Filtered and ranked games based on their positive rating ratios.

Price vs. Number of Owners – Investigated whether cheaper games are more widely owned.

Common Tags in Top-Rated Games – Analyzed recurring tags or features among the highest-rated games.

Review Trends for Free Games – Compared average negative reviews between free and paid games.

Genres with Highest Positive Ratings – Determined which genres receive the most positive feedback on average.
